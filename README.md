Social media platforms has revolutionized the landscape of communication, providing individuals with an outlet to express their thoughts,emotions,and experiences openly. This task focuses on the development of a model to determine whether individuals exhibit signs of depression based on their social media texts.Several modelslike KNN,Decission Tree,Support Vector Machine,Random Forest,Navie Bayes were built and the accurcay was compared.Among which Naive Bayes approach had better  performance and accuracy,  and it  was chosen for the detection task.The Naive Bayes algorithm, a probabilistic classifier, was applied to extract features and classify the texts. The model leveraged linguistic patterns, sentiment analysis, and other relevant features to capture indicators of depression within the texts.
